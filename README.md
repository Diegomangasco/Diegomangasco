## About me
I am a Computer Engineering student at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).
My master degree is focused on the main ICT topics (Networking, System and device programming, Web applications, Databases, Computer Architecture, Cloud computing, etc...) and on Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis.

## Personal interests
My favourite themes are Machine learning, Big Data and Cloud computing, especially I'm interested on Data Engineering that is the topic that can merge all of the aforementioned interests.

## My skills
* Python and some libraries associated (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch)
* Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop
* Docker and Kubernetes
* Rustlang
* Golang
* C and C++
* Java
* Javascript and some frameworks associated (Node, React, Svelte)
* SQL and NoSQL (in particular MongoDB)
