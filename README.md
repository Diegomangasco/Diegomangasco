## About me
I am a Computer Engineering student at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/).
My master degree is focused on the main ICT topics (Networking, System and device programming Web applications, Database, Computer Architecture, Cloud computing, etc...) and on Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis.

### Perosnal interests
My favourite topics are Machine learning, Big Data and Cloud computing, especially I'm interested on Data Engineering that can be a role to merge all of these three topics.

### My skills
* Python and some libraries associated (Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch)
* Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop
* Networking, Docker and Kubernetes
* Rustlang
* Golang
* C and C++
* Java
* Javascript and some frameworks associated (Node, React, Svelte)
* SQL and NoSQL (in particular MongoDB)
